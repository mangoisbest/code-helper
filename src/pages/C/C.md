# Welcome to the C Programming Language!

C is a programming language for general-purpose computers. Dennis Ritchie invented it in the 1970s, and it is still widely used and influential today. C's features are designed to accurately reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs.


# Variables

Variables in C are simple to understand and use, and they are an essential part of your C coding and projects. To start creating a variable in C, type "int" for number variables, "float" for floating numbers, and "char" for single character variables first, followed by the variable name.
Then add a "'="' to set a value or just leave it as "'int/float/char variable name"'. As an example:
```C
// Create variables
int myNum = 5;             // Integer (whole number)
float myFloatNum = 5.99;   // Floating point number
char myLetter = 'D';       // Character

// Print variables
printf("%d\n", myNum);
printf("%f\n", myFloatNum);
printf("%c\n", myLetter);
```
