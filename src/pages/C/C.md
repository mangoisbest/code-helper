# Welcome to the C Programming Language!

C is a powerful general-purpose computer programming language. Dennis Ritchie invented it in the 1970s, and it is still widely used, influential, and popular today. C's features are intended to accurately reflect the capabilities of the CPUs in question. C is also widely used in game development and is found in a variety of operating systems such as Windows and Mac.


# Variables


Variables in C are a crucial part of your C coding journey and projects because they are simple to understand and implement. To begin, type "int" for number variables, "float" for floating numbers, and "char" for single character variables first, followed by the variable name.
Then, either add a "'="' to set a value or leave it as "'int/float/char variable name"'. As an illustration:

```C
// Create variables
int myNum = 5;             // Integer (whole number)
float myFloatNum = 5.99;   // Floating point number
char myLetter = 'D';       // Character

// Print variables
printf("%d\n", myNum);
printf("%f\n", myFloatNum);
printf("%c\n", myLetter);
```
