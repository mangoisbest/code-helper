# Welcome to the Lua Programming Language!

Lua is a multi-paradigm, lightweight programming language primarily intended for use in embedded applications. Because the compiled bytecode interpreter is written in ANSI C, and Lua has a relatively simple C API for embedding it into applications, Lua is cross-platform.


# Variables

Variables in Lua are easy to understand and use, and they are an important part of Lua coding and your projects. To begin creating a variable in Lua, type "local" first, then the variable name.
Then you can put a "'="' after it to set a value or just leave it as "'local variable name"'. An example:
```lua
local val = 10

print(val) -- Outputs 10 once
```
