	<h1>Welcome to the C++ Programming Lanaguge</h1>
	<p>C++, or "C with Classes," is a general-purpose programming language developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language.</p>
	<h1>Variables</h1>
	<p>ariables are containers for storing data values.

In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
bool - stores values with two states: true or false</p>
