# Welcome to the Lua Programming Language!

Lua is a multi-paradigm, lightweight programming language designed primarily for embedded use in applications. Lua is cross-platform because the compiled bytecode interpreter is written in ANSI C, and Lua has a relatively simple C API for embedding it into applications.


# Variables

Variables in Lua are very simple to understand and use, and they are an essential part of Lua coding. To create a variable in Lua, type "'local"' first, followed by the variable name.
Then you can put a "'="' after it to set a value or just leave it as "'local variable name"'. An example:
```lua
local val = 10

print(val) -- Outputs 10 once
```
