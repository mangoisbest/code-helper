# Welcome to the Lua Programming Language!

engine and so does there studio for developers to create there own games


# Variables

Variables in Lua are really easy to understand and don't take long to learn and are an essential part to Lua coding. To first make a variable in Lua you will need to write ```local``` first and then the variable name after.
Then you can put an ```=``` after to set a value to it or just leave it as ```local x```. An example:
```lua
local x = 10

print(x)
```
`Outputs 10`
