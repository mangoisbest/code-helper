# Welcome to the Koltin Programming Langauge!

Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.

# Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values. To create a variable, use ```var``` or ```val```, and assign a value to it with the equal sign (```=```):

### Syntax

```kotlin
var variableName = value
val variableName = value
```

### Example 

```kotlin
var name = "John"
val birthyear = 1975

println(name)          // Print the value of name
println(birthyear)     // Print the value of birthyear
```
