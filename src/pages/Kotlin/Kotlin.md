# Welcome to the Koltin Programming Langauge!

Kotlin is a general-purpose, cross-platform, statically typed programming language with type inference. Kotlin is intended to be fully compatible with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library is based on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows for more concise syntax.

# Variables

Variables are important in Koltin because every project requires them to store and hold values. Variables are containers that hold data values. To make a variable, type "'var"' or "'val"' and then give it a value with the equal sign ("'="'):

### Syntax

```kotlin
var variableName = value
val variableName = value
```

### Example 

```kotlin
var name = "John"
val birthyear = 1975

println(name)          // Print the value of name
println(birthyear)     // Print the value of birthyear
```
